        <h1>Latest News</h1>
        <p>Galliano, who went on to design those famed bias-cut gowns that swirl around curves like wet meringue, clearly got over this particular point of distaste. And then came his instant classic <strong>Maison Margiela Artisanal</strong> show last week, in which, among other countless moments of glory, tits—and hips, and even pubic hair (they were merkins, but still)—were on full display. The female body, exaggerated to beyond-Jessica Rabbit, beyond-Kardashian proportions with hip padding and corsetry, was presented as dramatic, luxurious, and even a little frightening. And in a first for Galliano, and an extreme rarity for couture, a significant portion of those models were not straight size. Sumptuous flesh for sumptuous clothes.</p>
        <p><a href="trends.html#trend">This beautiful couture collection</a>, nearly a year in the making, is deservedly everywhere, a moment of cultural domination not seen in fashion in recent memory, if ever (monoculture is dead, except for this). We are all waxing rhapsodically about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/patmcgrathreal/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pat McGrath’s</a> makeup and Pat Boguslawski’s choreography and the decadent set and the clothes—the jaw dropping clothes, which Galliano invented several new techniques to construct. The clear points of inspiration—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassa%C3%AF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brassaï</a>, the photographer who documented seedy Parisian nightlife in the 1920s and 30s, whom Galliano has looked to since his 1988 “Hairclips” collection, and the dancing doll from Fellini’s <em>Casanova</em>—are classic Galliano. The collection spans references he loves from the post-revolution French subculture les Incroyables to fabrics that were treated to look as though they’d been dragged through water (in times with leaner budgets, he’d douse his runway models with it).</p>
        
        <h2>Galliano Revived Fashion</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Galliano’s non-straight size models were used as assets.</li>
        <li>The casting didn’t feature the same few non-straight size models that you see on rotation, the three or so who have managed to really break through. </li>
        <li> There was of course the 6’3” <em>Gwendoline Christie</em>, who closed the show in spectacular fashion in a sheer rubber-accented dress, and the popular Jill Kortleve.</li>

        <p>My personal thoughts on this? Oh boy, I am <strong>IN LOVE!</strong> Nothing could've prepared any of us for this show. It changed everything, it set the bar so high for everyone in the industry.</p>
        <p>I was left speechless, my soul left my body. Every single outfit was simply angelic, doll like. It reignited my passion for real couture fashion. I can't wait to see what is in store for us these upcoming fashion shows. There will be so much to talk about!</p>
